        CO2eq Effects from Albedo Changes due to Potential Afforestation for
        Ecoregions across Canada
      description: >
        [taken from product README]
        Data table entries report CO2eq in [kg C m-2 ground] representing the
        CO2-equivalent climate cooling impact (negative indicates warming
        effect) caused by albedo changes from afforestation with transition from
        an original non-forest biome to a new forest biome.  For example, a
        value of -6 kg C m-2 indicates that the albedo change has a climate
        effect equivalent to an emission of 6 kg C (as CO2) per square meter
        afforested.  Results assume 100% conversion from non-forest to forest
        cover, and thus represent a maximum effect.  In reality, forest cover
        expansion on afforestation sites may occur gradually as the
        afforestation process unfolds, thus there may be a transient approach to
        this maximum that takes place over time.
